    <h2>Research</h2>

    <p class="section-intro">
      My research explores how climate hazards shape public health, livelihoods, and humanitarian systems.
      I use quantitative and qualitative data to understand
      how risks are experienced and how institutions prepare for and respond to climate-related crises.

      <h3>Academic Alliance on Anticipatory Action (4A)</h3>
      <p class="meta">Consortium of universities | Global</p>
      <p>
        As a member of the Academic Alliance on Anticipatory Action, I contributed to collective research
        strengthening the evidence base for anticipatory action. I led an evaluation in Mali assessing an
        innovative early action funding mechanism designed for drought emergencies, and collaborated with
        partners including the Bezos Earth Fund to synthesize the most up-to-date global evidence on anticipatory action.

      <h3>Anticipatory Insurance for Drought</h3>
      <p class="meta">Malawi & Zambia</p>
      <p>
        I led a team of four from project conception through completion on a mixed-methods cost-benefit analysis
        of forecast-based drought insurance. This work informed the development and piloting of anticipatory
        insurance programs in Malawi and Zambia, contributing to national and humanitarian strategies to act
        earlier in the face of emerging drought risk.

      <h3>Anticipatory Action for Health in a Changing Climate</h3>
      <p class="meta">Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre</p>
      <p>
        I helped compile a global landscape of anticipatory action for public health, mapping climate-sensitive
        health risks and identifying opportunities for early action. This work also included evaluating a
        sovereign drought insurance payout across four countries to understand how policies and SOPs affect
        payout timing and effectiveness.

      <h3>Climate-Sensitive Infectious Disease & Early Warning</h3>
      <p class="meta">East Africa | Red Cross Climate Centre: Health Team</p>
      <p>
        Using key informant interviews and targeted evidence reviews, I explored how environmental indicators
        (air quality, rainfall, temperature) can strengthen early warning systems for climate-sensitive infectious diseases.

      <h3>How Americans Cope: Hurricane Helene</h3>
      <p class="meta">Asheville, NC</p>
      <p>
        This project examines coping strategies used by survivors of Hurricane Helene through key informant
        interviews and media-based content analysis. A rapid report produced in the immediate aftermath of the
        hurricane secured additional funding to expand the research to include immigrant and refugee communities.
