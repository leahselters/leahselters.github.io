      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a PhD Candidate in the Agriculture, Food, and Environment program at
        the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, with an MPH from Tufts School of Medicine.
        My work focuses on the intersection of <strong>climate change, public health, and disasters</strong>,
        with a regional focus on southern Africa.
      </p>

      <p>
        My research examines how communities, governments, and humanitarian actors understand and respond
        to climate extremes, particularly drought, and how these responses influence
        health, resilience, and vulnerability. I work across sectors to support evidence-based approaches to anticipatory action and climate-sensitive health policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Across all my work, I am committed to strengthening public health systems,
        improving early action for climate disasters, and centering local experience in the design
        of forward-looking, equitable climate and health strategies.
